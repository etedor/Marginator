Marginator
---
An AutoHotKey script for widescreen, high-resolution monitors.

Have you ever moved and resized your windows to get things to look centred, yet still *know* they aren't quite there? Marginator's for you.  

## Usage
`Win+Shift+Up`: Resizes the active window to be 75% of the screen's width (and 100% of its height, taskbar excluded) and centres it on the monitor it's on. **Great for websites that don't nicely centre their content.**

`Win+Shift+C`: Moves the active window to the centre of the screen it's on, without resizing it. **Useful when watching videos in a windowed player.**
