Marginator

An AutoHotKey script for widescreen, high-resolution monitors.

Have you ever moved and resized your windows to get things to look centered, yet still *know* they aren't quite there? Marginator's for you.  

## Usage
`Ctrl+Alt+C`: Resizes the active window to be 85% of the screen's width and height, and centers it on the screen it's on.

`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+C`: Resizes the active window to be 50% of the screen's width and height, and centers it on the screen it's on.
